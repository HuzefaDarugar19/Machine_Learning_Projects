# 🚀 Machine Learning Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Projects Repository**!  
Here you'll find a collection of projects where I explore real-world datasets and apply machine learning techniques to uncover insights, make predictions, and solve business problems.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- 📊 **Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)**
- 🤖 **Supervised Learning** (Linear Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, etc.)
- 🧩 **Unsupervised Learning** (KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering)
- 🛠️ **Model Tuning & Evaluation** (GridSearchCV, Cross-validation, RMSE, Accuracy, Precision, Recall)
- 🌐 **Deployment (Coming Soon)**: Web apps using **Streamlit** & **FastAPI**

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder contains:
- ✅ `notebook.ipynb` — clean, well-commented Jupyter Notebook
- 📝 `README.md` — short explanation of the project
- 📦 `model.pkl` or saved model (if applicable)
- includes source datasets

## 🌍 Deployment Plans

Some of these projects will soon be deployed as **interactive web applications** using:
- 🎯 **Streamlit** for user-friendly UI
- ⚡ **FastAPI** for scalable backend inference
- 🐳 Docker for containerization
