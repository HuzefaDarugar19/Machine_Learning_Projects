# 🚕 Taxi Price Prediction using LightGBM

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to predict taxi fare prices using historical ride data and machine learning techniques. The model is trained using **LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)**, a fast, distributed, high-performance gradient boosting framework based on decision tree algorithms.

---

## 📊 Objective

The primary goal is to build a regression model that accurately predicts the price of a taxi ride based on features such as:

- Pickup and dropoff locations
- Distance between points
- Date and time of travel
- Passenger count
- Any other relevant engineered features

---

## 🧠 Model Used

- **LightGBM**: A powerful and efficient gradient boosting framework. It performs exceptionally well on structured data and large datasets. LightGBM also supports categorical features directly and offers high speed and accuracy.

## 📈 Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Outlier removal  
   - Feature engineering (distance, time-based features)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Understanding trends, patterns, and correlations

3. **Model Training**  
   - Splitting dataset into train/test  
   - Training LightGBM model  
   - Hyperparameter tuning (optional)

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Metrics used: RMSE, MAE, R²  
   - Visualization of predictions vs actuals

## 🚀 Results

- Achieved a strong predictive performance using LightGBM.
- The model generalizes well to unseen data and provides a reliable taxi fare estimate.
